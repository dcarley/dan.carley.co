I recently attended two conferences; [Lead Developer](http://2015.theleaddeveloper.com/)
and [Operability](http://operability.io). The organisers of both have done
an excellent job of publishing good quality videos of the talks. Here is a
list of talks that I really enjoyed, benefited from, and would recommend
other people to watch. I won't attempt to summarise them for fear of missing
something out and there are better summaries on the internet already. I'll
forewarn you that there's a bias towards people skills over technology.
