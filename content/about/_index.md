title: About
---

I'm an experienced systems administrator, software developer, and network
engineer. I enjoy writing code in Go and contributing to open source
projects.

Away from the screen I can be found climbing, cycling, photographing,
generally being outdoors, and parenting like an eternal novice.

You can find me on..
